**What can you say about the complexity of your code?**
Currently the time complexity is O(n^2). As I am iterating the list of sentence twice using a nested loop.

**How will your algorithm scale?**
I could have thought of optimizing the iteration process where i am currently iterating the set of sentences twice. Due to which the time complexity of the solution provided by me in big O (n^2). I want to explore the kadane's algorithm and check if that can be used in any manner so that i can reduce the time complexity.

**If you had two weeks to do this task, what would you have done differently? What
would be better?**

I would have adopted the current approach of using bitwise and sentence value calculation. But my main focus area would have been on the iteration process. This would determine my time complexity.
